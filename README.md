## About Me
I started my career off as a local IT/Configuration Manager for a Software department of around 250 Engineers. After four years learner I moved to supporting 5,000+ Engineers as an IT Analyst. In this role I was responsible for learning, architecting, deploying, integrating, and continually improving Software Development Lifecycle applications (SDLC). After moving up to Principal IT Analyst and being a lead for over 7 SDLC application I felt like I was outgrowing my current position.  Having worked closely with Software Engineering Management, Engineers, and Configuration Managers I really respected the work that they do and found a passion of my own in building Web Applications. 

After some self-training and attending a 6 month Full Stack coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota I knew this is something that I want to pursue. Knowing that a bootcamp alone is not enough to consider myself a Full stack developer I performed a skills gap analysis to see what the most in demand skills in the industry were. After identifying my weaknesses and where I would like to be, I created a project plan (along with handy Gantt chart) to aid in developing my developer skills even further. Being curious in the whole Web development process I decided to take trainings in UX/UI, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, Databases (SQL+NoSQL), JavaScript, jQuery, Unit Testing, React, C#, ASP.NET Core, and some beginner/intermediate algorithms.

As of now, I'm still working to this project plan and started teaching Web Development Part-time. After a couple weeks of teaching and reporting enhancements to the curriculum I was offered a Part-time Quality Assurance role which I really enjoy. I'm hoping to find full-time employment with a company that I'm passionate about which includes Healthcare, building productivity apps, or anything that has a purpose for making peoples lives better.
